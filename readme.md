first of all i created two class , the first one i called Componnet One , and The Other One Component Two 
in each of the two Components i created a private variable called logger that get an Object of type logger.
after that i created a void function and call her FunctionOne() and FunctionTwo() there i called the logger property with all it's labels (trace -> debug -> info -> warn -> error -> fatal ) 
after it i created the main program , created the two Components and then to each one i call the functions and lanch to get the result on the display console.
